## To run distribution

To build, be sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed.
Then in the directory, simply run:

    npm install

You must also have `grunt-cli` installed globally:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Building the game:

	grunt

After building, run it with:

    npm run dev

And you will have the game running on http://localhost:8080
